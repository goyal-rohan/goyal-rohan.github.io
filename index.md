## About Me

I am a first year PhD student at MIT advised by [Yael Tauman Kalai](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/yael/) and [Vinod Vaikuntanathan](https://people.csail.mit.edu/vinodv/). My main interest is in error correcting codes, cryptography and theoretical CS very broadly.

Before this, I did my BSc.(Hons) from Chennai Mathematical Institute. During my undergrad, I was lucky enough to work with [Prahladh Harsha](https://www.tcs.tifr.res.in/~prahladh/) and [Mrinal Kumar](https://mrinalkr.bitbucket.io/).


## Research Interests

- **Coding Theory and Cryptography**
- **High Dimensional Expanders and Sampling**
- **Algebra and Computation**
- **Approximaton and randomized algorithms (and hardness)**
- Anything with a mix of Combinatorics, Algebra and Randomization!

## Publications:
- **Fast list-decoding of univariate multiplicity and folded Reed-Solomon codes** (FOCS 2024)\   [[ECCC](https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2023/185/)] [[Simon's Talk by Prahladh](https://www.youtube.com/live/t3AdyuYaPzI?si=Yalpe2fbju6czVSb)] \
  with Prahladh Harsha, Mrinal Kumar and Ashutosh Shankar 

## Olympiad and Outreach

- **Indian Mathematical Olympiads:**  I am currently also quite involved with Mathematical Olympiads in India. I help with team training for IMO and EGMO, problem selection, problem proposing and organizing selection camps from the national stage. If you wish to help or support the EGMO program in India, proposing or teaching, please feel free to reach out!
  
- **Outreach:**  I am also interested in understanding and improving school education in India especially in Mathematics and Computer Science. I want to understand how logical reasoning, puzzle solving and other aspects of problem solving can be inculcated into students at the grassroots level. I am also interested in increasing opportunities, awareness and recogonition for students who demonstrate extraordinary interest or capability in STEM fields.
  
Most of my activities till now have only catered to students who have demonstrated extra-ordinary talent in Mathematics mostly through Olympiads and other competitive exams. I would be extremely interested in any opportunities to work on more grassroots' level for Mathematics education, Computational and Logical Thinking, Problem Solving etc. **If you have any such opportunities where my experience would be useful, please feel free to reach out**. For a list of activities I have been involved in, please check my [cv](assets/files/rohan-cv.pdf).

## Some Olympiad Writings:

Please visit [my old blog](https://rgtdfg.blogspot.com/p/handouts.html) for a list of Olympiad writings. (mostly outdated right now but I hope to update it soon. I don't like most of them anymore either as they are quite terse and hard to read.)

## Talks and Achievements:
Please check my [cv](assets/files/rohan-cv.pdf).

## Other Interests:
I love playing chess and badminton. I am also interested in watching all kinds of sports: archery, cricket, figure skating, football (for Americans: soccer) etc.
