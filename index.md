## About Me

I am a final year undergraduate student at Chennai Mathematical Insititute pursuing a BSc. in Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science. I am widely interested in Theoretical Computer Science and Combinatorics. I was lucky enough to spend my summer in 2023 at TIFR, Mumbai interning under Prahladh Harsha and got to interact with so many wonderful people like Mrinal Kumar, Ramprasad Saptarshi and Jaikumar Radhakrishnan! I also got to interact with the PhD. students at TIFR and am extremely grateful for the same. This opportunity also led to me working on my first ever paper! Currently, I am applying to PhD programs for research in Computer Science.


## Research Interests

- **Coding Theory:** Error Correcting Codes, Fast Algorithms for decoding, encoding, testing etc. along with Cryptographic and other applications.
- **Extremal Combinatorics:** Sunflower Conjecture, Ramsey Theory etc.
- **Algebra and Computation:** Computational Group Theory, Ring Theory etc.
- **Approximaton Algorithms:** Mix of randomness and approximation both in online and offline settings.
- Anything with a mix of Combinatorics, Algebra and Randomization!

## Olympiad and Outreach

- **Indian Mathematical Olympiads:**  I am currently also quite involved with Mathematical Olympiads in India. I help with team training, problem selection, problem proposing and organizing selection camps. I was also fortunate to be the deputy leader for our team at [EGMO 2023](https://www.egmo.org/egmos/egmo12/countries/country35/). If you wish to help or support the EGMO program in India, proposing or teaching, please feel free to reach out! I also particpated in Mathematical Olympiads as a student and represented India at the IMO in 2021. I am now enjoying the other side of activities and not having to stress about exams :D
- 
- **Outreach:**  I am also interested in understanding and improving school education in India especially in Mathematics and Computer Science. I want to understand how logical reasoning, puzzle solving and other aspects of problem solving can be inculcated into students at the grassroots level. I am also interested in increasing opportunities, awareness and recogonition for students who demonstrate extraordinary interest or capability in STEM fields.
  
Most of my activities till now have only catered to students who have demonstrated extra-ordinary talent in Mathematics mostly through Olympiads and other competitive exams. I would be extremely interested in any opportunities to work on more grassroots' level for Mathematics education, Computational and Logical Thinking, Problem Solving etc. **If you have any such opportunities where my experience would be useful, please feel free to reach out**. For a list of activities I have been involved in, please check my cv.

## Some Olympiad Writings:

Please visit [my old blog](https://rgtdfg.blogspot.com/p/handouts.html) for a list of Olympiad writings. (mostly outdated right now but I hope to update it soon.)

## Talks and Achievements:
Please check my cv downloadable from the sidepane for information.

## Other Interests:
I love playing chess and badminton. I am also interested in watching all kinds of sports: archery, cricket, figure skating, football (for Americans: soccer) etc. I am love watching movies, reading novels etc. More recently, I have gotten more and more into reading historical and non fictional books but still enjoy the occasional fantasy, fiction, etc. I am also a potterhead :p.
