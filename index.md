## About Me

I am a second-year PhD student in the Theory of Computation Group at MIT, where I am extremely fortunate to be advised by Yael Tauman Kalai.

Before this, I did my BSc.(Hons) in Mathematics and Computer Science from [Chennai Mathematical Institute](https://www.cmi.ac.in/). During my undergrad, I was lucky enough to be advised by [Prahladh Harsha](https://www.tcs.tifr.res.in/~prahladh/) and [Mrinal Kumar](https://mrinalkr.bitbucket.io/). I also spent summer 2024 in at [IRIF Paris](https://www.irif.fr/) working under [David Saulpic](https://www.normalesup.org/~saulpic/) on clustering algorithms.


## Research Interests

My main interest is in error correction, proof systems, and more generally theoretical CS. I tend to enjoy most problems with flavours of combinatorics, algebra and randomization.

## Publications:
All authors are in alphabetical order of last name.

- **Fast list-recovery of univariate multiplicity and folded Reed-Solomon codes** \
with [Prahladh Harsha](https://www.tcs.tifr.res.in/~prahladh/), [Mrinal Kumar](https://mrinalkr.bitbucket.io/) and [Ashutosh Shankar](https://sites.google.com/view/ashutoshs/home)

## Olympiad and Outreach

- **Indian Mathematical Olympiads:**  I am currently also quite involved with Mathematical Olympiads in India. I help with team training for IMO and EGMO, problem selection, problem proposing and organizing selection camps from the national stage. If you wish to help or support the EGMO program in India, proposing or teaching, please feel free to reach out!
  
- **Outreach:**  I am also interested in understanding and improving school education in India especially in Mathematics and Computer Science. I want to understand how logical reasoning, puzzle solving and other aspects of problem solving can be inculcated into students at the grassroots level. I am also interested in increasing opportunities, awareness and recogonition for students who demonstrate extraordinary interest or capability in STEM fields.
  
I would be extremely interested in any opportunities to work on more grassroots' level for Mathematics education, Computational and Logical Thinking, Problem Solving etc. **If you have any such opportunities where my experience would be useful, please feel free to reach out**. For a list of activities I have been involved in, please reach out to me via email.

## Some Olympiad Writings:

Please visit [my old blog](https://rgtdfg.blogspot.com/p/handouts.html) for a list of Olympiad writings. (mostly outdated right now but I hope to update it soon. I don't like most of them anymore either as they are quite terse and hard to read.)
